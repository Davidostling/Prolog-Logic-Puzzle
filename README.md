# Prolog Logical Puzzle
In this repository, I solved a basic logical puzzle using SWISH and Prolog. The instructions for the puzzle are provided within the file itself as comments.

### Testing
To test the solution, please paste the code into an editor (eg. https://swish.swi-prolog.org/) and run the following command in the console:

### `run ?- waiters(Ls).`
